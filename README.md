# Next.js Data Fetching Error in Nested Pages

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications: data fetching errors in nested pages directories. Specifically, this issue involves using `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` within nested routes.  The problem arises when the data fetching functions are not correctly configured, leading to incorrect or missing data rendering in the nested page.

## Bug Description

The bug involves a failure to fetch data correctly using `getServerSideProps` within a nested page. This leads to a blank or incorrectly rendered page. This issue is specifically tied to the structure and configuration of the Next.js application, not necessarily to the data fetching logic itself. The application might appear to work correctly in simpler structures but fail in more complex ones.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates correct configuration of the Next.js application to correctly handle data fetching in nested pages. It involves careful attention to the structure and configuration options of Next.js to ensure that the data fetching functions are correctly identified and executed.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`. You'll see an error or blank page in the initial state of the bug.
5. After applying the solution, navigate to `/about` again to see the correct data.
