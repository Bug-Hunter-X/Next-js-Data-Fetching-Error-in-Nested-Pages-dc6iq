In Next.js, an uncommon error arises when using server-side props (`getServerSideProps`) or static generation (`getStaticProps`) within a nested `pages` directory structure. If these functions are not correctly implemented or if the file system structure is not organized optimally, Next.js might fail to locate and execute them, leading to unexpected behavior such as blank pages or incorrect data rendering.

For instance, consider this file structure:

```
pages/
  index.js
  about/
    index.js
```

If `about/index.js` uses `getServerSideProps`, but is not properly configured in `next.config.js` for dynamic routing, Next.js might not correctly fetch the data during rendering, resulting in a blank or incorrect page.
